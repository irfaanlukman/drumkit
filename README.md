DESCRIPTION:

In this simple project, we are required to combine the fundamentals of Javascript, HTML and CSS to create a web-browser drum kit application. It is a simple application involving basic concepts involving all 3 languages to further enhance knowledge and understanding.

What I learned:

1. A new skill earned was linking the keyboard input into html script and learning the different data keys associated with each keyboard input.

2. Linking an audio source file into HTML script and calling upon iit later in JS.

3. Using a similar attribute selector from CSS in JS to cache the audio and key DOM from html to js.

4. Further enhanced understanding of logic flow of JS in creating a sequence of how the application should work.
